Web App for valuing numbers by uploading csv with a column of phone numbers. Patterns are recognised using regex expressions and then a csv file is returned
providing a masked number and the pattern that was found.

Business Problem:
During my placement year I started a small business selling phone numbers on ebay. This involved sorting through 1000's of numbers to find ones that may be valuable, specifically numbers with repeating digits or patterns of digits that would be easy to remember to look good to read on websites or advertising. At first we used excel to find numbers with patterns using various formulas, this worked but was sluggish and we still had to manually price the numbers and prepare advertisements to list the numbers.
